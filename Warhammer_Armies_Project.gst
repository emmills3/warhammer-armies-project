      <description>Scouts are set up after all other non-Scout units from both armies have been deployed, and do not count toward determining who finished deploying their army first. They can be set up either in their controlling player&apos;s deployment zone as normal, or anywhere on the battlefield more than 12&quot; away from the enemy. If deployed in this second way, Scouts cannot declare a charge in the first turn if their side goes first.

If both players&apos; armies contain Scouts, players should roll off. The players then alternate deploying their scouting units one at a time, starting with the player who won the roll-off.</description>

      <description>Skirmish Formation
Skirmishers are deployed in a &apos;loose&apos; formation, where the models are not placed in base contact, but are positioned roughly 1/2&quot; apart. The models in the unit must still face the same direction and the unit will still have a front, two flanks and a rear. All Skirmishers in a unit do not count as blocking each other’s Line of Sight. As long as you can draw a Line of Sight from the front rank to the target, the second and subsequent ranks may fire too. In addition, Skirmishers may be fielded in formations of less than five models wide, as long as they do not have more ranks than files.

When moving Skirmishers, you should measure from the location of each model before it moves and place it anywhere within its Mt Allowance (or double its M Allowance if it is marching), except when there is a unit or impassable terrain in the way, the distance moved must include the distance required to move around these obstacles.

Vanguard
Skirmishers (except models with Fly rule) automatically have Vanguard.

Skirmishers and Charging
If skirmishers declare a charge (or a charge reaction that does not involve fleeing) they tighten their loose formation into a &apos;normal&apos; formation after the charge distance is rolled and the chargers are moved. This happens &apos;for free&apos; at the moment both units move into base contact. The unit immediately forms up in base contact around the centremost model in the front rank (the Skirmishers&apos; controlling player can choose which if the front rank has an even number of models) that is also in base contact with the enemy.

The number of ranks, files and the formation&apos;s facing do not alter as the Skirmishers tighten up – all that happens is that models that were previously spaced out are now in base contact with one another. This has the effect of rendering the Skirmishers&apos; loose formation into a regular shape so that other units can fight them in the normal way.

If the Skirmishers are not in base contact with an enemy in the Remaining Moves sub-phase, the controlling player must move them apart so that they readopt their loose formation.

Free Reform
A unit of Skirmishers moves, wheels, marches and charges just like other troops. However, unless it charges, a skirmishing unit is allowed to reform twice during its move; once before they move, and at the end of their move. The unit may do this even if it marches, provided that no model ends up moving a number of inches higher than double its M value.

Feigned Flight
A unit of Skirmishers that chooses Flee as a charge reaction does not cause Panic from fleeing through friendly units and automatically rallies in its next Compulsory Movement Phase. In addition, it is then also free to move during the remaining moves part of the Movement phase. The unit is also free to shoot as normal (but always counts as having moved). Note that if the flee move of the Skirmishers do not take them beyond the charge reach of their enemies, the unit suffers casualties as normal.

Fire on the March
Skirmishers can shoot even if they marched or reformed earlier in the turn (providing their weapon doesn&apos;t have Move or Fire). However, the normal -1 To Hit penalty for moving and shooting still applies.

Light Troops
All shots aimed at a unit of Skirmishers suffer an additional -1 To Hit penalty. Skirmishers always count as having zero ranks, and therefore cannot claim a rank bonus, be steadfast, or disrupt an enemy with a flank or rear attack – they make supporting attacks as normal, however.

Characters
A character model that joins a unit of Skirmishers gains the Skirmisher special rule as long as they stay with the unit. A character on a mount cannot join a unit of Skirmishers.</description>

      <description>Frenzied troops gain +1 A and Immunity (Psychology).

Berserk Rage
If a Frenzied unit is within their maximum charge range of an enemy unit but chooses not to declare a charge, then they must pass a LD test or move directly towards the closest enemy unit within Line of Sight, marching if possible, in the Remaining Moves phase. If no enemy units are visible, the unit may move as normal.

A unit that includes one or more Frenzied models cannot choose to restrain pursuit if it beats a foe in close combat. It will either pursue (if the enemy has fled) or overrun (if the enemy was wiped out in combat).

Note that if the enemy is wiped out in combat but the Frenzied unit did not charge that turn (or if the combat was the result of a pursuit or overrun charge in the same turn), then the Frenzied unit will reform as normal as it has no other choice of action.

Losing Frenzy
Frenzy can be lost. Models retain their Frenzy for the entire game unless beaten in combat.</description>

Moving Flyers
Flyers can move 10&quot;. Flyers, begin and end their movement on the ground.

Units made up entirely of models that can fly can move or charge normally on the ground, using their M, or instead choose to fly. A unit that flies can move over other units and terrain as it does so, treating the entire move as taking place over open ground. It may not finish the move on top of another unit or in impassable terrain. If a model has Large Target it is able to draw a line of sight over intervening units to a more distant target and make a flying charge over the intervening unit. A unit that makes a flying charge does so using the glide move of 10&quot; as its M.</description>

Until they pass the Stupidity test again, models that have failed their Stupidity test have Immunity (Psychology), Random Movement (D6), cannot choose to do a combat reform, and Wizards cannot attempt to cast or channel power dice or dispel dice.</description>

Moving Flyers
Flyers can move 10&quot;. Flyers, begin and end their movement on the ground.

Units made up entirely of models that can fly can move or charge normally on the ground, using their M, or instead choose to fly. A unit that flies can move over other units and terrain as it does so, treating the entire move as taking place over open ground. It may not finish the move on top of another unit or in impassable terrain. If a model has Large Target it is able to draw a line of sight over intervening units to a more distant target and make a flying charge over the intervening unit. A unit that makes a flying charge does so using the glide move of 10&quot; as its M.

Flying March
A unit that is flying can march as normal, doubling its flying move to 20&quot;, representing a particularly long swoop or glide.

If a fleeing unit has a musician, it may re-roll its LD test whenever itattempts to rally.

Swift Reform
A unit that is not fleeing and not engaged in combat can make a swift reform during the Remaining Moves sub-phase if it has a musician. A swift reform is treated exactly like a reform manoeuvre, however the following exceptions apply:

 A unit performing a swift reform may not change their formation by decreasing or increasing their ranks. The unit may only turn on the spot by pivoting like a lone model.

 A unit that has made a swift reform can immediately make a full normal move, even though a reform would normally prevent it from doing so. Note that a unit that carries out a swift reform cannot march.

 A unit that has made a swift reform can still shoot, although it will count as moving, whether or not it moves further after the reform has been completed. This means that it will suffer the -1 modifier for moving and firing, and will not be able to shoot Move or Fire weapons.</description>

Fast Cavalry automatically have Vanguard.

Free Reform
Unless it charges, Fast Cavalry is allowed to reform twice during its move without losing any Movement; once before they move, and at the end of their move. The unit may do this even if it marches, provided that no model ends up moving a number of inches higher than double its Movement value.

Characters
If a Fast Cavalry unit is joined by a non-cavalry character or a Cavalry character with an armour save higher than 5+, the unit loses the rule until the character leaves.

Fire &amp; Flee
A unit of Fast Cavalry armed with missile weapons can choose Fire and Flee as a charge reaction. If it chooses to do so, the unit will first fire upon the target following the rules for Stand &amp; Shoot. After this, the unit makes a flee move. However, they may not use Swiftstride if they do so, and the normal -1 To Hit penalty for moving and shooting still applies.

Feigned Flight
A unit of Fast Cavalry that chooses Flee or Fire &amp; Flee as a charge reaction does not cause Panic from fleeing through friendly units and automatically rallies in its next Compulsory Movement Phase. In addition, it is then also free to move during the remaining moves part of the Movement phase. The unit is also free to shoot as normal (but always counts as having moved). Note that if the flee move of the Fast Cavalry does not take them beyond the charge reach of their enemies, the unit suffers casualties as normal.

Fire on the March
Fast Cavalry armed with missile weapons are expert at shooting from horseback and can therefore shoot during a turn in which they marched or reformed (providing their weapon doesn&apos;t have Move or Fire). However, the normal -1 To Hit penalty for moving and shooting still applies.

In the event that a model has more than one Breath Weapon attack, it is permitted to use only one in a single turn.

After each Breath Weapon has been used the first time, roll a D6 before attempting to use it again in later rounds. On 4+, it may be used as normal. On a 1-3, the model is literally out of breath, and cannot use its Breath Weapon this round. It may choose to attack normally in close combat instead.

Note that Breath Weapons are not physical attacks, and certain models may be Immune to the effects of some Breath Weapons. However, all Breath weapons Ignore Cover.

Breath Weapon Shooting Attack
If the model is not in close combat, it can use its Breath Weapon during its Shooting phase. A Breath Weapon shooting attack can be made even if the model marched or reformed during the same turn.

To perform the attack, place the flame template so that it lies entirely within the model&apos;s forward arc, with the narrow end touching the creature&apos;s mouth, and so that it is not touching any friendly units or enemy units that are in close combat. All models that they even partially under the template are automatically hit.

Breath Weapon Close Combat Attack
If the model is in close combat, it can use the Breath Weapon instead of using its normal attacks. A model that makes a breath weapon attack in this way inflicts 2D6 automatic hits (resolved like shooting) on a single enemy unit in base contact – if there is more than one enemy unit in base contact with the model, the controlling player chooses which enemy unit suffers the hits.

      <description>Models with Random Movement do not have a M value, but rather a dice roll. This is the distance they move, charge, pursue, overrun and flee – they cannot march. If a model has Random Movement and Swiftstride, then Swiftstride is not used. Note that certain Random Movement rolls can result in the model having a M value higher than 10 – this is an exception to the usual maximum.

Models with Random Movement cannot declare charges, and are always moved in the Compulsory Moves sub-phase. When the model moves, first pivot it about its centre to face the direction in which you wish it to travel. Then move the model after rolling the specific dice. No other pivots can be made.

There&apos;s a chance that the model&apos;s peculiar movement will cause it to come into contact with an enemy, so measure the distance in a straight line before the model is moved. If the move is found to take the unit’s front arc into contact with an enemy, then it counts as charging, and this is resolved using the normal rules for charges and using the distance rolled as its charge range. Charge reactions cannot be declared against enemies with Random Movement.

If the random move brings the unit to within 1&quot; of a friendly unit or impassable terrain, it stops immediately and cannot move further during that Movement phase.

If two or more models in a unit have the Random Movement, pivot the unit about its centre, then roll the dice only once to determine how for the unit moves. If models in the unit have a different Random Movement value, use the slowest for the entire unit.

A Random Move counts as a &quot;normal&quot; move for triggering a Dangerous Terrain test, unless the model is making a charge, pursuit or flee move, in which case it counts as a move of the appropriate type.</description>

Volley Fire cannot be used if the target is within half the weapon&apos;s maximum range.

Immunity can also include Panic, Fear and Terror. If the majority of the models in a unit have the Immunity (Panic, Fear or Terror), the unit ignores the effects of Panic, Fear or Terror and any such tests it would otherwise had to take.
Models that are Immune to all three above effects have Immunity (Psychology).

Killing Blow is only effective against Infantry, Cavalry and War beasts. Against Monstrous Infantry, Monstrous Cavalry and Monsters, a successful Killing Blow only inflicts one Wound which Ignores Armour saves. Against other troop types, it has no effect.

      <description>A Mixed Unit most often consist of two different Troop Types, with one or more handlers that drive the rest of the unit forward. The handler(s) should always be deployed in the rear rank of the unit, and may be the only models to join the rear rank. Mixed Units cannot be joined by characters, unless specified.

If a Mixed unit is required to take a characteristic test, this is done using the characteristics of the unit itself, not the handler. The only exception is LD tests, which are taken using the unit’s highest LD value. When the models in a unit with the Mixed Unit special rule have different M allowances, the handlers M value is ignored, unless they are the only models remaining. Any other special rules that the unit might have do not apply to the handlers, unless specified.

As long as the unit (but not the handlers) have a unit strength of 5 or more, any missile hits are resolved against the unit itself. At less than unit strength 5, there is a chance that any handlers in the unit could be hit – the controlling player decides who is hit, but must allocate one hit on each model before they can add a second hit on a model; they must allocate two hits on each model before they can allocate a third, and so on. Hits from templates are resolved against the handlers as normal. In close combat, the handlers can only be attacked by models who are in base contact with them.</description>

If the random move brings the unit to within 1&quot; of a friendly unit or impassable terrain, it stops immediately and cannot move further during that Movement phase.

If two or more models in a unit have the Random Movement, pivot the unit about its centre, then roll the dice only once to determine how for the unit moves. If models in the unit have a different Random Movement value, use the slowest for the entire unit.

A Random Move counts as a &quot;normal&quot; move for triggering a Dangerous Terrain test, unless the model is making a charge, pursuit or flee move, in which case it counts as a move of the appropriate type.</description>

Regeneration may not be used against Flaming Attacks, successful Killing Blows (including Heroic Killing Blow) or wounds caused due the unit being Unstable.</description>

      <description>Some models have a special save called a Ward save. The value of a ward save will be shown in brackets. These work in the same way as armour saves, and may be combined with other types of Ward saves as normal. Ward saves are never modified by the S of the attack. No model may have a Ward save better than 4+ by combining multiple Ward saves; single Ward saves with a better value than 4+ are always specified as such.

If a model has both an armour save and a Ward save, the model takes its armour save as normal. If the armour save is failed (or modified to the point at which the model cannot pass it) then the model takes its Ward save.</description>

Immunity can also include Panic, Fear and Terror. If the majority of the models in a unit have the Immunity (Panic, Fear or Terror), the unit ignores the effects of Panic, Fear or Terror and any such tests it would otherwise had to take.
